# Hand Written Digit Recognition
Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in python from which the mnist data set is loaded. The mnist data set consists of total 70,000 images of digits; 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing. The images are taken from various documents converted in grayscale, 28x28 pixels and centered to reduce preprocessing. Therefore very less preprocessing is required only to fit for the model which is built using CNN. 
A simple interface is built using canvas and with various buttons to predict the written image on canvas and clear the canvas. The background of canvas is set to black and the pointer is white to make the image like images in dataset.

## Requirements
- Python 3 or above
- Keras library
- Tensorflow
